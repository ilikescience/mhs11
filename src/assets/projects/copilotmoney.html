  <p>
I joined the Copilot Money team in late 2024 at an important crossroads: fresh off an influx of new users from the shutdown of their main competitor, the team needed to orient themselves towards a future of hard work and growth. I was brought in to help set the quality bar for the product, and to help ship a powerful new feature: Goals.</p>
<h2>Branding</h2>
<p>One of my first tasks was to overhaul the branding and marketing language to meet Copilot Money's ambition; before, the visual presentation of the product used cartoon visuals and generic tone of voice. I engaged <a href="#">Cardinal</a> for a rapid sprint to get the brand ready for a big marketing push during the holiday season.</p>

  <h2>Design System</h2>
  <p>From Copilot Money's inception, engineers had been building without a design system. This resulted in slow development, requiring many aspects of the UI to be built and re-built. Inconsistencies were common, and very little documentation existed. I worked with the team to build a design system, including over 30 common components and 50+ new icons across two color themes and two platform variants.</p>
