<p>
Stripe's merchant experience — the set of tools that merchants use to run their business — is at the core of the company's mission to increase the GDP of the internet. And Stripe's merchants are increasingly running their entire business from their phone. From solo founders of internet-only businesses, to small businesses who collect payments using tap-to-pay, to entire fleets of salespeople who are using text messages to pitch new clients, for manay people, commerce is mobile.
</p>
<p>
  Despite this reality, in 2023, Stripe's two flagship mobile-focused products — <strong>tap to pay</strong> and <strong>payment links</strong> — were not available via Stripe's mobile app. When I joined the mobile team, we set out to change this.

  <h2>Supporting features</h2>
  <p>Seldom is adding a feature to an existing app as simple as a few screens; adding payment links to the Stripe app required many additional features that hadn't had a reason to exist in the app so far:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding, listing, and editing products</li>
    <li>Creating multiple price points for a product</li>
    <li>Adding discounts</li>
    <li>Switching payment types during a transaction</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And the list went on. The team exhaustively mapped out all the supporting features for payment links, and plotted a course to implement them leading up to the launch of payment links.</p>

  <h2>Entry points and discoverability</h2>
  <p>Another challenge when introducing new features is putting them where a user is likely to find them, but not at the expense of existing patterns and muscle memory. For payments links and tap to pay, we explored a wide number of options, from enabling users to create new payments from the tab bar, to more contextual alternatives.  </p>

<div class="project--section">
  <p>Initially we chose to keep the navigation consistent with existing patterns, using a native context menu component to limit interference with existing workflows.</p>

<div class="project--section">
  <p>Tap-to-pay and payment links both reduced the likelihood of chargebacks, since they eliminate the possibility of mistyping a customer's card info. So, we designed forward-looking versions of payment flows that increased the adoption of these features.</p>

  <h2>New opportunities</h2>
  <p>Because the merchant was using their phone in these contexts, and likely interacting with customers face-to-face, we could take advantage of QR codes and native sharing to make the payment process more seamless. Both of these integrations increased adoption of payment links substantially, making it a clear example of non-zero-sum strategy; instead of canabalizing users, the mobile app created entirely new user segments.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>By adding tap-to-pay and payment links to the Stripe app, we supported existing mobile-first merchants and enabled entirely new use cases. The impact was immediate: in the 6 months after launching these features, monthly active users of the app had jumped from <strong>372k to 517k (2&times;)</strong> and payment volume from the mobile app had gone from <strong>$32M to $130M (4&times;)</strong>. Bringing more features to users through the mobile app is now a proven strategy to grow adoption of Stripe's products.</p>
