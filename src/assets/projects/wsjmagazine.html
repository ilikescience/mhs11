                <p>
                    WSJ. Magazine is a monthly luxury fashion and lifestyle magazine published by the Wall Street Journal. After a renewed editorial vision transformed the print edition, the magazine's digital footprint needed to catch up. The magazine's photography and journalism win awards and attract the world's top luxury advertisers, so nothing short of perfection would do.

        <h2>Before: blending into the crowd</h2>
        <p>
            In 2017, the homepage for WSJ. Magazine was built on the same platform as the rest of the Wall Street Journal's pages. The page was curated and constructed using the same tools and building blocks as the homepage of the Journal itself. Unsurprisingly, this resulted in a feeling of sameness between the two pages.

        </figure>
        <p>
            In response to this shift, the editors of the Wall Street Journal wanted to begin exploring how the homepage can be a standalone news-reading experience. The goal was to provide a snapshot of the news that could quickly adapt to the minute-by-minute coverage the Journal provided. The homepage would not only need to change to reflect the news, but also accomodate a wide variety of reading behaviors, advertising needs, and business goals.
