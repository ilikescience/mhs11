Eleven is a free music magazine. It was started in 2006 by a group of people, including myself, at Washington University in St. Louis.

Over the course of 4 years, with the help of university funding, we published 20 issues, learning the ropes of publishing a magazine.

In 2009, two of the original staffers and I took the magazine from a college-funded endeavor to a full-fledged ad-supported publishing company.

Between 2009 and 2010, I served as the Creative Director of Eleven, seeing its expansion to a monthly music magazine, publishing 8 more issues and setting the groundwork for the coming years.

In 2011, Eleven PDX published its first issue in Portland, and Eleven was brought under the leadership of a new publisher.

In 2016, 10 years after it published its first issue, Eleven announced it would cease publishing in St. Louis.

Below are 1,052 pages I designed or directed over 7 years.
