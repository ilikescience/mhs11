For the longest time I put Slaughterhouse-Five in the category of "books some kids read in high school." I didn't read it — I didn't read _Lord of the Flies_ or _Animal Farm_ or _1984_ or _Catch-22_ — and no big deal. I got others, like _Great Gatsby,_ _The Good Earth,_ _The Razor's Edge,_ and _The Remains of the Day._

I picked it up for a short vacation read, and goodness ... if I had read it in high school, I might be a very different person today. Vonnegut's blasé commentary on the horrors of the war, tied to the science fiction of Billy Pilgrim's time travel journeys, was such a radically new type of story to me. Novels have never interested me in the same way that non-fiction and science fiction do, but based on this I'm reconsidering my dismissal of those high school assignments. I'll have to give _Brave New World_ another shot.
