Economics is one of the subjects I really want to know more about. I figured a good place to start was a biography of one of the most famous economists of all times, John Maynard Keynes.

This is a great historic biography. One of the things that surprised me was the fact that Keynes was openly and unapologetically bisexual â€” he was in the so-called "Bloomsbury Group," which included Virginia Woolf and E. M. Forester, and which flaunted non-manogomy and sexual liberation. It's hard to understand why the contemporary attitude towards Keynes' contribution to the British economic recovery after World War I wasn't shaded by his sexuality nearly as much as, say, Alan Turing's was after World War II.
