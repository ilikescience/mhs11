I loved _The Martian._ Weir's way of writing characters, especially their dialogue, has such an effortless humor and familiarity about it; it's almost too relatable, but relatable to my internal mental dialogue, like a stream of consciousness in short spoken form.

_Project Hail Mary_ has all the same ingrients that made _The Martian_ great: the humor, the urgency, the drama of isolation, the excitement of problem-solving and ingenuity. But _Project Hail Mary_ differs from _The Martian_ in a lot of ways, too: it's much more far-fetched in premise, closer to a far-future Neal Stephenson story than the near-future realism of _The Martian_. It's also got aspects of _The Three-Body Problem_ and [_Children of Time_](reading/children-of-time), which all serve to keep the book fresh.

Overall, I think Weir is trying to not be too much of a one-trick pony, but he's risking losing the magic of that one trick. A good, fast read, but nothing exceptional.
