I'm always hungry for more Buddhist writing. I feel like I haven't quite found the right reliable source for self-guided study, so I'll often pick up books purely on the basis of being vaguely about Buddhism. This book had a lot of great material to offer â€” specifically around the concept of nothingness, emptiness, and personal development within that space. However, the framing of the journey to understanding the self within the context of a sexual experience (the last chapter is about orgasms) was a little hard to reckon with.
