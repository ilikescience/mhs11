I picked this up looking for something light after a few meaty non-fiction books. It's a suspenseful account of Browder's fight against the Russian oligarchy, a really shocking expos√© on the lengths rich politicians will go to in order to make and keep money. There were two things that kept me from really enjoying it, though:

1. Browder consistently describes the men in his story by their intelligence and cunning, and describes the women in their story by their appearance.
2. All the negative consequences of Browder's investments in Russia, especially the death of his friend, were the result of his own opportunism and greed.
