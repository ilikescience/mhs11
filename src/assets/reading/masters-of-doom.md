Growing up, I didn't play much _Doom_ or _Quake._ I had friends who were rabid fans of the gory shoot-em-up genre, but by the time those games were becoming mainstays, I was thoroughly engrossed in RPGs like _Final Fantasy_ and adventure games like _The Legend of Zelda_. But two of John Carmack and John Romero's games were formative in my video game experience: _Wolfenstein 3d_ and _Commander Keen_.

So, _Masters of Doom_ had me hooked from the start. It's a really well-researched book, written in first-person accounts with a focus on the personalities of the two Johns. They're relatable guys, especially to split-brained folks like me: Romero has his creative ambitions, Carmack his obsession with pushing the technical envelope.

Even if you're just mildly interested in games, this one's a solid read. It manages to capture the spirit of a very particular point in time, when PCs were turning from nerdy pastime and boring business to massive entertainment machine.
