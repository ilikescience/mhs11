It's definitely worthwhile spending some time understanding the growth and evolution of capitalism, especially as it pertains to the emergence of the United States as a world power. This book is full of historical facts, mostly organized around the "great men" of the gilded age: John Astor, J.P. Morgan, John Rockafeller Andrew Carnegie, etc. etc. But I really struggled to stay engaged with the information that the book offered. It stuck primary to the what, who, and when, and carefully tiptoed around the why.

I guess I'm going to have to _Das Kapital_.
