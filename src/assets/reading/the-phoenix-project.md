One of my favorite business books is [_The Goal_](/reading/the-goal). _The Phoenix Project_ is like _The Goal,_ but a little more specialized for tech.

The first half of the book covers a manager's journey to wrangling with the chaotic nature of large-scale IT teams. (Aside: that the book uses "IT" as the catchall phrase for the engineering organization is a marker of its age — but its lessons are still applicable to today's world, where IT is just a tiny department in charge of people's laptops.) The key points — maintain flow, make work visible, limit work in progress, etc — are incredibly salient and applicable to design teams just as much as they are to developer teams.

The second half of the book focuses more specifically on DevOps as a practice. When _The Phoenix Project_ was written, DevOps was a much more novel concept. But today, it's pretty well taken for granted. This means that the insights and advice given in this latter half aren't quite as applicable as the general principles given earlier.

Overall, highly recommended for anyone in tech.
