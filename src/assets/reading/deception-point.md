I picked this up because of my fond memories of reading _The DaVinci Code_ and _Angels and Demons_ as a teen. However, it fell significantly short of expectations. The characters came across as flat and uninspired, lacking the depth and complexity that would make the reader invest in their journeys. 

The narrative was bogged down by lengthy exposition, which not only disrupted the pace but also felt like a tedious lecture at times. The plot, while aiming for a grand reveal, was overwrought and its predictability sapped the thrill out of the unfolding mystery.
