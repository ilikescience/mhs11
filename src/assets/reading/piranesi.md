Wow. I picked up _Piranesi_ on a recommendation from the almighty algorithm, desparate for a read that wasn't historical nonfiction or standard-fare sci-fi. The book defies any genre description, other than maybe "mythological psychological fantasy fiction," but even that is pretty misleading. It's a great story, unusual in its willingness to leave the reader feeling uncertain and disoriented. It's a short, easy read, and incredibly memorable.
